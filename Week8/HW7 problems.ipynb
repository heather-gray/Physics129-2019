    "Because the electromagnetic interaction conserves parity, the angular distribution cannot contain any terms that are odd under parity inversion, i.e. parity must be conserved.  However, as we'll learn later in the course, weak interactions do not conserve parity.  In this case, since the $Z$ boson has the same quantum numbers as the photon, diagrams involving the $Z$ and the photon both contribute to the $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ cross section.  And because there are the same initial and final states, the interference between these two diagrams introduces a term that violates parity.  Plot the angular distribution (i.e. $\\cos{\\theta}$) for the $\\mu^+$ and for the $\\mu^-$.  Is there evidence of parity violation in these plots?"
