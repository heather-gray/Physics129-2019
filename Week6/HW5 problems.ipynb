    "\n",
    "In lecture 1, you were introduced to the vector bosons corresponding to the fundamental forces. Today, we'll focus on the $Z$-boson, the neutral vector boson corresponding to the weak force. Experiments at the LEP $e^+e^-$ collider at CERN made very precise measurements of the properties of the $Z$ boson. Some of the earliest measurements were to determine the $Z$ mass and width. But, we'll focus here today about how to use this data to constrain the number of light neutrino species that the $Z$ can decay to. This problem uses data compiled by the Particle Data Group to reproduce these measurements, so please feel free to consult your booklets. A detailed discussion of the processs $e^+e^-\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow anything$ can be found in Chapter 16 of Thompson. The concepts used in this problem are presented in Section 16.2, but we'll discuss them much later in the course. Today, the goal is to try out the fitting skills that you've developed in class and use them to extract results from the data."

Here hadrons indicates the sum of all the different decays of the $Z$ boson to different types of hadrons. Remember the connection between the decay rate and the width discussed in class.\n",

The precise variable that we'll use is called $R$, which is defined as the ratio of the measured rate for $e^+e^- \\rightarrow $hadrons to the predicted cross section for $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$. It turns out that taking this ratio makes is easier to see some of the important physical effects of the $Z$ resonance.\n",
