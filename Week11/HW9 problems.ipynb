    "## Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first experimental evidence for the existence of the\n",
    "gluon came from the analysis of data collected at the Petra\n",
    "accelerator at DESY.  Several different analysis strategies\n",
    "were used by the four collaborations (see [arxiv:1012.2288](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2288.pdf) for a review).  One such analysis, performed by the\n",
    "Tasso group, was based on studies of the sphericity tensor:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum_i p_{i\\alpha} p_{i\\beta}}{\\sum_i\n",
    "  \\vec p_i^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the sum is over all charged particles in the event\n",
    "(Tasso did not have good enough calorimetry to include neutrals\n",
    "in the analysis) and the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ indices run\n",
    "from 1 to 3, representing the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components\n",
    "of the momentum vector.  For each event,\n",
    "the Sphericity tensor can be\n",
    "diagonalized to obtain the principle axes $\\hat n_1$ through\n",
    "$\\hat n_3$ and eigenvalues $Q_1$ through $Q_3$.\n",
    "With the definition of $S$ above, $Q_1+Q_2+Q_3=1$, so we only\n",
    "need two eigenvalues to specify each event. \n",
    "If the\n",
    "eigenvalues are ordered so that $Q_1<Q_2<Q_3$ then the\n",
    "sphericity is defined to be\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S \\equiv \\frac{3}{2}\\left (1 - Q_3\\right )  = \\frac{3}{2} \\left (Q_1+Q_2 \\right )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and the aplanarity is defined to be\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A \\equiv \\frac{3}{2} Q_1 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here $0<S<1$ and $0<A < 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the form of the sphericity tensor is the same\n",
    "as that of the moment of interia tensor (where the object's\n",
    "position is replaced by its momentum).  We can therefore\n",
    "use our intuition from classical mechanics to interpret this\n",
    "tensor.  Long, thin rods have one large eigenvalue and two\n",
    "small ones of rougly equal size, while a sphere has three\n",
    "eigenvalues of equal size.  If we interpret the the\n",
    "process $e^+e^-\\rightarrow hadrons$ at parton level as\n",
    "$e^+e^-\\rightarrow q\\overline q$ we would expect most of\n",
    "the momentum to flow along the original $q\\overline q$ axis\n",
    "with the momentum transverse to this direction limited to\n",
    "a scale set by $\\Lambda_{QCD}$.  Thus, such events have $S$\n",
    "close to zero.  The axis $n_3$ is a good estimate of\n",
    "the initial direction of the back-to-back $q$ and $\\overline q$.\n",
    "If instead a single hard gluon is radiated so that\n",
    "the hard scattering process is $e^+e^-\\rightarrow q\\overline qg$,\n",
    "the events would appear planar with only a small component of \n",
