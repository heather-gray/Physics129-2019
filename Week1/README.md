# Introduction to Python
A series of 3 Jupyter notebooks for Python beginners with emphasis on physics. No previous experience required, though familiriaty with college-level physics will help. Intended for Berkeley physics undergrads to help them use Python in their coursework.

The intended order of notebooks is:
1. `Intro to Python.ipynb`
2. `Intro to numerics.ipynb`
3. `Intro to stats.ipynb`

### Please fill out the feedback survey [here](https://forms.gle/UN3bFxiXg19GJfy9A) after completing the tutorials

[Click here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=avirukt&repo=intro_python&branch=master&path=Intro%20to%20Python.ipynb
) to open the first notebook at `datahub.berkeley.edu`. This will ask you log in via CalNet, then create a Jupyer server for you, clone this repository to your account on [DataHub](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack), and then launch and direct you to the first notebook. You can also run the notebooks in your own environment by cloning/downloading this repo and launching the [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For more information see the first notebook.


## This series of notebooks is intended to
- introduce you to concepts and paradigms that are commonly used when programming
- introduce you to the syntax and quirks of Python and NumPy
- give you a rough idea of the advantages and limitations of numerical computation
- convince you of the power/utility of numerics
- show you how to use some commonly used techniques and tools
- help you get over the intial intimidation of learning how to code
- force you to learn how to read documentation, and help you get over the fear of unknown packages
- give you the ability and confidence to solve new problems yourself

### This is NOT supposed to be a comprehensive guide to all numerical coding in Python.
