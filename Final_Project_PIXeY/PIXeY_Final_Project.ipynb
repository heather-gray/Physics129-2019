    "Time projection chambers (TPCs), particularly those using liquid xenon, have been used to conduct extremeley sensitive searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), one of the leading dark matter candidates. For example, the LUX and XENON1T experiments have recently published final results, and their successors, LZ and XENONnT, are currently under construction. In this project, you will conduct analysis on xenon TPC calibration data collected in a smaller detector called PIXeY, which stands for Particle Identification in Xenon at Yale (where it was originally run; it's successor, CoDeX, is located at Berkeley but currently not operational)."

    "Time projection chambers are designed to allow reconstruction of the 3D position, energy, and interaction type for particles that scatter in the active region. An incoming particle that scatters in the detector induces prompt scintillation that is collected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) at the top and bottom of the detector--this light is called the S1 signal. The interaction will also ionize some xenon atoms. The liberated electrons are drifted towards the liquid surface of the detector by an applied electric field. When the electrons are liberated from the liquid surface and enter the gaseous xenon vapor above it, they also produce scintillation. This delayed signal is the S2 signal. See Figure 1 for a visual representation of these signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the applied electric field is sufficiently well-modelled, the time between S1 and S2 can be turned into a $z$ coordinate for the interaction. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates can be estimated from the hit pattern on the PMT arrays. The sizes of the two signals are correlated to the energy deposited in the recoil, and their relative size to one another can be used to categorize whether the particle scattered off the xenon nucleus or one of its electrons."

    "To understand a TPC's response over a wide range of recoil energies, we use a variety of calibration sources to induce recoils of known energy in the detector. Then we can map the S1 and S2 that we see to those energies. This method is particularly effective when the calibration source is monoenergetic. LUX used a variety of radioactive isotopes to map out the detector response to electronic recoils, shown in Figure 3. As an aside, LUX also had a nuclear recoil calibration program, which is described in more detail in [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in Figure 3, each monoenergetic source appears roughly as a small blob in S1 versus S2. The axes of this plot are in units of single photoelectrons (spe), which are the typical units used for PMT outputs. A true PMT pulse represents at the minimum the detection of a single photon, so there is a well-defined and consistent single photon pulse size for a PMT when it is run at fixed settings. Normalizing to the detected number of photons also facilitates the comparison of the outputs of different PMTs, which might have slightly different gain values in their electronic output.\n",

We must calibrate the gain of S1 and S2 separately since there is inherent amplifcation in the extracted electron signal. Note that these gain factors are detector dependent values."

Extrapolating the fitted line to the intercepts gives a good estimate of the gain factors. For a more detailed description of this process, see section D in [3]. \n",

    "$^{83\\mathrm{m}}$Kr is a dispersed source, which means it is dissolved into the xenon to allow for decays uniformly spread throughout the active volume. The decay of this isotope actually proceeds in two steps--the first step has a half life of 1.8 hours and the second only 154 nanoseconds. For our purposes, we will treat these decays as a single 42 keV source and attempt to reconstruct the energy deposited in the PIXeY detector. However, the half-life of the intermediate state is just long enough that some of the decays appear with two S1s, while some occur quickly enough in succession that the S1s are totally overlapped. For more information about the decay structure of $^{83\\mathrm{m}}$Kr, see [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aside: $^{83\\mathrm{m}}$Kr was used as a dispersed source in LUX to map out the electric field, as described in [4]. You can plot $r^2$ versus $z$ to visualize the apparent distribution of uniform events using the PIXeY data. Nonuniformities are usually taken to be a result of errors in the position reconstruction or electric field modelling (i.e. we assume the source has been uniformly dispersed)."
